      "The N.C. Department of Transportation has set a priority to spend down the cash balance by increasing transportation construction across North Carolina.  The cash balance is essentially NCDOT's \"checkbook\" for delivering transportation projects. Cash spending on transportation projects is a leading indicator to economic growth.<br /><br />NCDOT operates on a cash-flow basis, which means the department may award contracts against future revenues. The advantage of a cash-flow method is that transportation tax collections are returned to the taxpayer in the form of transportation improvements much sooner than on a \"pay-as-you-go\" basis.<br /><br />NCDOT's goal is to maintain a cash balance less than $750 million and greater than the required 7.5 percent of the total appropriations for the current fiscal year (from July 1 to June 30). <a href='/about-us/how-we-operate/finance-budget/Pages/default.aspx'>Learn more about DOT’s budget, revenue and spending.</a>",

      "Note: Unaudited financial report<br /><br />North Carolina G.S. 143C-6-11 revised the cash balance floor to at least 7.5 percent of the total appropriations for the current fiscal year. If this floor is not maintained, no further transportation project contract commitments may be entered into until the floor is restored.<br /><br />Session Law 2014-100 Senate Bill 744 Section 34.23(c) established a cash balance ceiling of $1 billion. If the balance exceeds the ceiling, NCDOT must report to the N.C. General Assembly and Fiscal Research the reasons for exceeding the ceiling and the plans to reduce the balance.",
